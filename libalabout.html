    <p>Welcome</p>
    Libal Trinity Academy is a educational institution based in Accra and open to 
   children aged 18 months to 18 years.<br>
    <img class="adout" src="clogo.png" />
   <p>It was founded by Mr. Solomon Bagmae 
   The school began with six children, ages two to three years September 2008, 
   and so it was that the Libal Trinity Academy took off. 
   The success of the pre-school resulted in the setting up of the Kindergarten in 2009 which was followed by the start of the 
   first phase of LibaL Trinity Primary and Junior High School in the subsequent years.</p><br>
  

   <p>Today, Libal Trinity Academy is one of the top private schools in Ghana, with a student and staff body of over 800 individuals,
   and offering an enriched British curriculum with a distinct focus on entrepreneurial leadership from the Primary level. 
   The school building is also a landmark edifice prominently situated on the Ngleshie Amanfrom. 
   Libal Trinity Academy continues to expand its physical infrastructure.</p><br>
